This repo contains information and files related to my GitHub Challenge from 8/23/16 - 9/23/16.
I intend to:
1.  Complete the code school course "Try Ruby"
-- still working through the "try ruby" course on code school 8/25/16
So far, the methods in Ruby seem very similar to Javascript.  I like the "to_s" to stringify method (for example).

Other methods on strings, arrays, objects, etc:  
poem.lines.to_a.reverse.join   


2.  Complete the following code school course in the Ruby Path
3.  If I feel ready, I will build a simple app using Ruby. Otherwise, I will complete another code School course or seek other resources and tutorials
4.  I will research and attempt to rebuild a previous basic app/assignment using new technology.
